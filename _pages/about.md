  <div class="imageLeft-content"><p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my website! I am a recently graduated McMaster University student, graduating from the Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering and Management (CO-OP) program.</p>
  <p>This means I have spent the past six years of my life either on coop/internship or doing in-class work. In total, I have had two co-op terms (4-months each) at two different companies and one internship (16-months) at a third company. The program I am in is a five-year program, requiring around 180 total units of coursework that essentially gives me a Bachelors in Engineering and all the base knowledge of a business degree.</p></div>

During this time, I have been a member of the Data Acquisition Subteam, even leading the subteam for one design year. I have had the priviledge of joining the team at the 2018 competition in Maryland and the 2020 competition in Quebec. Finally, I even worked on a project for Baja as my final-year capstone, which you can see [here](noahzwiep.github.io/projects/capstone).
