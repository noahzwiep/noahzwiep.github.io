  <div class="imageLeft-content"><p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my website! I am a recently graduated McMaster University student, graduating from the Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering and Management (CO-OP) program.</p>
  <p>This means I have spent the past six years of my life either on coop/internship or doing in-class work. In total, I have had two co-op terms (4-months each) at two different companies and one internship (16-months) at a third company. The program I am in is a five-year program, requiring around 180 total units of coursework that essentially gives me a Bachelors in Engineering and all the base knowledge of a business degree.</p></div>
