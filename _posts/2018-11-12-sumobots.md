I have competed in both the junior and senior Sumobot Competitions at McMaster University.

In a team of four, an autonomous robot is designed for the purpose of pushing the other robot out of the ring. 

Here is a video showing the tracking used in our sumobot. The robot used a combination of infrared and ultraviolet sensors to determine where the opposing robot is and would move to push that robot out.

Here are examples of the robots we have created in competition. This first video shows our robot in the junior compeition:

In both competitions the robot was a finalist, making it to the final round.
