After my first year of university, I was just starting to get a feel for electronics and software. A friend of mine said he was working on a project that involved adding a brushless DC motor to a longboard utilizing a belt drive. He had an idea of using the rider's weight transfer to control the speed of the longboard. 

The project involved utilizing two load cells, one on each truck, to measure the amount of strain on each of the trucks. These load cells needed to be amplified and their voltages were measured by an Arduino. The Arduino filtered the values coming from the load cells and ulitized the difference in strain to determine the rate at which the longboard should increase its velocity. 

Unfortunately I do not have any photos of the mechanisms or the lithium-ion battery pack used in the board, but here is a video of me riding the board.
