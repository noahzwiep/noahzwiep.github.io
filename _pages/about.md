## Background
Hello, and thank-you for visiting my website! I am a recently graduated McMaster University student, graduating from the Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering and Management (CO-OP) program. 

What this means is I have spent the past six years of my life either on coop/internship or doing in-class work. In total, I have had two coop terms (4-months each) at two different companies and one internship (16-months) at a third company. The program I am in is a five-year program, requiring around 180 total units of coursework that essentially gives me a Bachelors in Engineering and all the base knoweledge of a business degree.
