## Background
As a final-year project, and being a member of the McMaster Baja Racing team, my project was aimed at doing something new with Baja SAE Racing. Baja SAE has mandated that all vehicles become AWD by 2021, previously only requiring two wheel drive. Because of this, a requirement was to design a performance all-wheel drive (AWD) system for a Baja vehicle. 

My team, comprising of myself, one other member in Mechatronics Engineering and Management, and two members in Mechanical Engineering and Management set out to design a performance AWD system. This was the first time a capstone group was comprised both of members in the Mechatronics Department and the Mechanical Department at McMaster University. 

The goal was to provide smart activation of torque to each of the front wheels of the vehicle indepenently. From this, the front wheels could be activated whenever the rear wheels would slip, and could be used as a means to provide torque vectoring around corners. If a system like this could be designed for the front wheels, it could easily be iterated on in the future to provide similar results on the rear wheels.

## Design

### Mechanical Design
There were tight requirements for the maximum size of the system, as it needed to fit near the driver's feet. The main focus of the mechanical design was three-fold: 
1. To transfer rotation from the axle along the underside of the vehicle to rotation to each of the wheels via a miter gear. 
2. To create a clutch pack that fits in the size restraints and can transfer the full torque of the motor. It must be able to be actuated electronically to provide variable torque outputs.
3. To step down the torque to match that of the rear wheels. 

At first a stepper motor was considered as the motor to use to rotate the helical gear that then translates the clutch pack. However, it was very difficult to find a stepper motor with a holding torque high enough to transfer the torque required. Stepper motors would also need to be constantly powered, which means ensuring batteries could power the motor for the entire 4-hour race would be difficult.

Instead, it was decided that a wormed DC motor would be used. Worm gears provide the benefit of being unable to be back-driven, meaning they could be driven to the correct position and would hold their position when power is cut. A motor with an enoder was used to ensure closed-loop feedback.

### Control Design
Much of the control design was done in Matlab's Simulink. The goal was to sense and put the vehicle into three different modes:
1. Traction Control (Wheel Slip)
2. Dynamic Control (Vehicle Cornering)
3. Manual Override (Driver Control)

The driver had an option to allow the control algorithm to decide the mode by flipping a switch into auto-mode, or to make all the decisions themselves by flipping the switch into manual mode. In manual mode, only the buttons on the driver's steering wheel would activate the clutches.

The auto-mode system was fully designed in Simulink, allowing for torque vectoring and traction control.

And PID values for motor control were obtained modelling the motor and using Simulink's PID tuner utility.

Finally, simulations were designed to prove overall system functionality:

### Sensor and Motor Low-Level Software
All low-level software and the GitHub repository can be found on this [project page](https://noahzwiep.github.io/Capstone/).

### Final Assembly
The first iteration of the design used planetary gears to be able to step down the torque:

</p>

Actually machining this design would be difficult due to tolerance stackups in the planetary gears, so this design was tabled for now. 

The second iteration of the design instead used off-the-shelf spur gears before the miter gear:

</p>


In the end, the design couldn't be fully realized due to lack of access to machining shops during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the design is complete and the control system is modular enough to be able to be placed on any system in the future.
